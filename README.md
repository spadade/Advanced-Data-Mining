Topics focus on the applied use of these techniques in realistic settings. Covers statistical and machine learning techniques.

Few of the algorithms that have been used for the projects are as below:

- Regression

Also not just applications of the algorithms but also the insights of them along with there actual usage in the real world senario are demonstrated.
